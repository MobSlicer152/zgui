This is my modified version of [zgui](https://github.com/zxvnme/zgui) that supports being used in C,
for [my game engine](https://github.com/RandomcodeDev/purpl-engine).

There might be some minor changes to the C++ code, since there were a few inconsistencies that I've
noticed and cleaned up. It's also not constrained to Windows anymore.
